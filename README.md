## READ ME PLEASE? Just some disclaimers. It means a lot. THANKS!

All states aren't persistent. As much as possible don't refresh the page to retain the data.

There are certain validations that are inserted.

Refreshing the page will remove the temporary accounts that you created and all the created buzzes along with it. 

## Functions

1. You can login using an already existing user (username: kevin | password: password).

2. Create a temporary account by signing up. Validations are implied. You cannot create an already existing account and you can't proceed if you mistakenly retyped your password wrongly.

3. Upon logging in, you can create new post that will be binded to your account.

4. You can easily logout the dashboard by pressing the Logout link on the top right side of the screen.

5. Technology used: Vue3, Vue Router, Vuex
